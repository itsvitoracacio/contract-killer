# Contract Killer w/ Ongoing Hosting & Maintenance

### _Note from Vitor:_
This Sam's version of the Contract Killer but adjusted it to fit the business model of redditor Citrous_Oyster.

**This means it's for an offer of a static website that focuses on performance and search engine rankings. It includes ongoing hosting and maintenance, and all changes and updates the client wants will be made by the developer, while the client will pay a monthly fee with no money down at the start.**

I love the stuff he shares, but I couldn't use the contract he had written, because after reading it, I thought it had some holes, some contradicting parts and it was just too confusing overall - I am not a lawyer though.

Stuff inside [brackets] are meant to be changed for anyone using this file. And stuff in _italic_ is what you probably want to review before sending the contract to each new client, as it might changed based on what you have agreed upon.

A special thanks to [Sam Sycamore](https://github.com/samuelsycamore) and [Ryan, aka Citrous_Oyster](https://github.com/Oak-Harbor-Kits).

Apart from that, I make Sam's words (below) my own. #100Devs

### _Note from Sam:_
I really appreciate the work of Andy Clarke and Stuff & Nonsense Ltd. for crafting [the original killer contract](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/).

That said, I don't love some of the more cheeky British humor baked in, and there are minor elements of the phrasing and grammar (plus spelling) that I would never use as an American.

This edit reflects the kind of language that feels more appropriate to me as someone who resides in the Bay Area, California. I have also included specific text to reflect the additional services that I offer. Your mileage may vary!

Shout-out to all the homies from #100devs! I hope you find this helpful!

# Design and Development Contract
Between [company name] and [customer name]

## 1. Summary:
I will always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it’s important to have things written down so that we both know what’s what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong.

In this contract you won’t find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I would never want to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what’s best for both parties, now and in the future. In short:

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] (“You”) are hiring me ([company name]) (“Me”) to:

[Design and develop a web site]

For the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence.

## 2. What do both parties agree to?
**You**: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You will give me the assets and information that I tell you I need to complete the project. You’ll do this when I ask and provide it in the formats I ask for. You’ll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. We will both be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

**Me**: I have the experience and ability to do everything I’ve discussed with you and I will do it all in a professional and timely manner. I will do my best to meet every deadline that’s set, and I will maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

## 3. Design
I create designs that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. I create them iteratively using HTML and CSS, and it would be a poor use of my time to mock up every template as a static visual. Sometimes I may use visuals to indicate a creative direction (color, texture and typography).

You will have plenty of opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. I will share a Github repository and development site with you and we will have regular contact via phone, email, or any video chat provider we agree to, such as Zoom or Skype.

## 4. Text content
I do provide professional copywriting and editing services, so if you’d like me to create new content, edit or proofreard it for you, I can provide a separate estimate.

## 5. Graphics and photographs
You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you can only provide files in non-editable formats, I can provice a separate estimate to recreate them as editable files. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a separate estimate.

## 6. Deliverable files
I deliver website projects as a folder containing the pages developed, in the following file formats: HTML for markup, CSS stylesheets for styling and JavaScript for behavior. I’ll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I am not required to keep a copy.

The collection of those files plus the external media linked in them (photos, videos, audio files) are rendered by a browser and form what we call websites. When these files are hosted on a server they become part of the web and can be accessed by other users across the world.


## 7. Browser testing
Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different screen sizes. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft (Edge), and Mozilla (Firefox). I will not test in other older browsers unless we agreed separately. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

## 8. Mobile browser testing
Testing using popular smaller screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. I test my designs in:

iOS: Safari and Google Chrome

Android: Google Chrome

I will not test in Opera Mini/Mobile, specific Android devices, or other mobile browsers.

## 9. Technical support
In order for the website to be live and accessible, it needs to be hosted on a server, and have a domain name pointing to it. Even though I can help you with domain registration, you need to do it yourself so you keep full ownership and control of the domain name.

_For hosting the website, I will use a third party company that owns the infrastructure necessary to keep the website live. Because of that, it is reasonable to expect that in some cases we may face issues that can take longer to solve due to their internal processes, and that we may be subject to the availability of their own support team.

As for the service of maintenance, performance updates and usage analytics, I will be the one taking care of that and keeping you informed whenever necessary._

## 10. Search engine optimization (SEO)
I do not guarantee improvements to your website’s search engine ranking, since that depends on the search engines themselves and on all other websites competing for the same rankings. That said, the pages I develop are accessible to search engines and go under a series of optimizations to help them have a higher chance of achieving good ranking positions.

## 11. Changes and revisions
I do not want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the amount of time that I estimate I'll need to accomplish everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, but I'm happy to be flexible. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem as I will provide a separate estimate for the additional time.

If — at any stage — you change your mind about what you want delivered or aren’t happy with the direction my work is taking, you will pay me in full for the time I've spent working until that point and may terminate this contract.

_As for changes after the website is live, you can request as many changes or updates to your website as you want, for the whole duration of our contract, unless specified otherwise. When requesting changes, it is essential that the website keeps its overall structure and is recognizable as the same website delivered initially._

_You will submit all requests for changes and updates in written form, preferably through email. I will reply with a confirmation of whether the change is doable and provide a time estimate to complete it. You can request multiple changes at once, although I will implement them one at a time, keeping the others in queue if needed._

_If this contract is terminated, I can move your website to a different hosting provider that you will have access to through your own credentials. Keep in mind that having it hosted with a third party provider may generate other ongoing costs for you._

## 12. Duration and termination
_This contract stays in place for a minimum amount of time of 6 months and need not be renewed after that._

_Once the website is live, ongoing services will be provided on a monthly basis until the contract is terminated by one of us, or both of us in agreement._

_The intent to terminate the contract needs to be communicated at least 15 days before the end of the monthly service cycle. The sole interruption of monthly payments does not configure contract termination._


## 13. Legal stuff
I will carry out my work in accordance with good industry practice and at the standard expected from a suitably qualified person with relevant experience. That said, I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can’t be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them.

Your liability to me will also be limited to the amount of fees payable under this contract and you won’t be liable to me or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if I’ve advised you of them.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

## 14. Intellectual property rights
“Intellectual property rights” means all patents, rights to inventions, copyright (including rights in software and other code) and related rights, trademarks, service marks, get up and trade names, internet domain names, rights to goodwill or to sue for passing off, rights in designs, database rights, rights in confidential information (including know-how) and any other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all applications (or rights to apply) for, and renewals or extensions of, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection which subsist or shall subsist now or in the future in any part of the world.

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them. When you provide text, images or other artwork to me, you agree to protect me from any claim by a third party that I'm using their intellectual property.

I guarantee that all elements of the work I deliver to you are either owned by me or I’ve obtained permission to provide them to you. When I provide text, images or other artwork to you, I agree to protect you from any claim by a third party that you’re using their intellectual property. Provided you’ve paid for the work and that this contract hasn’t been terminated, I will assign all intellectual property rights to you as follows:

You own all intellectual property rights of text, images, site specification and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

I will own any intellectual property rights I’ve developed prior to, or developed separately from this project and not paid for by you. I will own the content of the source files plus the visual components that I create for the project. I will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I’ll license its use to you (once paid in full), exclusively and in perpetuity, for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

## 15. Displaying my work
I love to display my work, so I reserve the right to publish all aspects of my creative work, including sketches, work-in-progress designs and the completed project on my portfolio and in articles on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

## 16. Payment schedule
You agree to pay for my services as outlined in the following payment schedule:

[Payment details]

[Payment schedule]

I issue invoices electronically. My payment terms are [number] days from the date of invoice by credit card. I can also accept wire transfers upon request. All proposals are quoted in US dollars.

I reserve the right to charge interest on all overdue debts at the rate of [percentage] per month or part of a month.

## 17. The not-so-small print
Neither of us can transfer this contract to anyone else without the other’s permission.

We both agree that we’ll adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to our activities under this contract and not cause the other to breach any relevant laws or regulations.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legally binding document.
